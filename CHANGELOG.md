## 2.0.0 - 2024-04-28

### Added

- Add a toggleable button for showing or hiding indirect mods. By default
  indirect mods are not shown. Indirect mods are installed as child mods from a
  top-level mod, and most of the time the setting screens are not relevant for
  those.
- Add a search/filter widget to hide non-matching mods. This is useful when you
  have a lot of mods installed. By typing a few characters, only mods with a
  matching name or id will be shown.

## 1.2.0 - 2024-04-28

### Fixed

- When pressing F3+Esc to pause the game, the mod could either crash, or
  incorrectly show the Mod Settings button. (Fixes #14)
